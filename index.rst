Blazer
======

`Backblaze B2 <https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html>`_ claims to be the lowest cost cloud storage available. Similar to Amazon S3 it is Ideal for file archiving, off-site backups and storing on-demand game assets. It is more robust and scalable than regular web hosting with data stored across a storage cluster. Files can be managed via a web interface, the command line or via an API.

Blazer is lightweight library allowing developers to easily add uploading, retrieving and managing data in B2 capabilities tot their software.

Blazer uses the .NET framework targeting approximately the CLR 3.5 runtime making it well suited to inclusion in Unity 3D games and applications.

It provides two main APIs. A lower level .NET API in the Blazer namespace and a more `Unity 3D <https://unity3d.com>`_ friendly API in the Blazer.Unity namespace.

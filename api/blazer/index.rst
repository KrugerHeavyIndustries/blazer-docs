Blazer Base API
===============

The Blazer base API is where the bulk of the actual functionality of Blazer is implemented. For the purposes of Unity developers it should be considered an opaque library. If demand for using the part of Blazer exists it may be further documented in the future. To use Blazer within Unity; see the Blazer.Unity documentation.
